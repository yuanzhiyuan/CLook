For 0.14
--------

  - [ ] Replace feature popups with inspector-like interface

For 0.15
--------

  - [ ] Feature selection
  - [ ] Better zoom control
    + Show all toggle levels.
    + Some kind of feedback for toggling.
  - [ ] More Tabix payloads (GFF/GTF)
  - [ ] Clean up featureSource creation (make async?)

For 1.0
--------

  - [ ] Undo/redo.  
  - [ ] History of recently-viewed tracks.
  - [ ]Out-to-chromosome zooming
    + Probably needs a better set of semantic zoom hints in the

Future
-------------

 - New stylesheet language

Nice to have
------------

 - Tier groups
     + Should yZoom together.
     + Other configuration stuff?
     + Drag together when re-ordering????
 - Dedicated configuration/persistance language?
 - Distance between a pair of features.
 - Multiple configurations/session switching/etc?
- RDF/FALDO support?

Blue sky
--------
    
 - MultiContigView equivalent?
 - Client-side analysis of quantitative tracks.
 - Better presentation of gene models in the light of expression data.
